## About Me

I am a **Junior Systems Analyst** with a robust journey in technology and over **14 years of experience** in the banking sector. Currently, I work in various areas, including customer service, branch operations, and information technology. Over the past two years, I have been developing my skills in planning, execution, management, testing, and project deployment, as well as conducting business requirements analysis and solution specifications. I actively participate in projects focused on operational improvements and innovations in **Contact Center environments**, including migrating legacy systems to the cloud.

With a strong focus on **Java programming**, I am honing my knowledge of frameworks like **Spring**, applying them in back-end solution development. I am expanding my expertise in **Java**, **SQL**, **Azure**, and **microservices**, continuously striving to grow in the field of technology. My degree in **Systems Analysis and Development**, combined with **Microsoft Azure certifications**, demonstrates my commitment to learning, innovation, and actively contributing to team and organizational success.

Throughout my career in national corporations, investment banks, and banking agencies, I have consistently excelled at leading diverse teams to achieve aggressive goals, regardless of technical challenges, while maintaining excellent client relationships.

## Vision and Goals

My primary goal is continuous hands-on growth, combined with **digital management**, **generative AI**, and **innovation**. To achieve this, I immerse myself in studying the works and strategies of influential thought leaders and entrepreneurs across technology, business, and finance.

In addition to iconic global innovators, I draw inspiration from leaders and visionaries in the financial and banking sector, both in Brazil and worldwide. This includes studying the success stories of prominent figures such as **Roberto Setubal** (Itaú Unibanco), **Luiz Carlos Trabuco Cappi** (Bradesco), and global leaders like **Jamie Dimon** (JPMorgan Chase). Their leadership exemplifies excellence in navigating the complexities of the financial industry.

I highly recommend exploring the following works, which provide deep insights into leadership, innovation, and strategic thinking in both technology and finance:
